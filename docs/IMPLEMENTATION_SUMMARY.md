## 🎨 Animation Examples

### Example 1: Hero Section Cascade
```
0ms:     Card slides up
100ms:   Title slides up
200ms:   Subtitle slides up
300ms:   Buttons appear
500ms:   Avatar scales in
Result:  Beautiful staggered entrance
```

### Example 2: Tag Animation
```
Hover on any tag:
  - Scale from 1.0 to 1.05
  - Move up 3 pixels
  - Background color changes
  - Text color changes to accent
  - All in 0.3 seconds smooth
```
