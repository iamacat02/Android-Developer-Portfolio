# ✅ FOLDER ORGANIZATION COMPLETE!

## 🎉 What Was Done

All guide files have been moved to a **dedicated `docs/` folder** for better separation and organization.

---

## 📊 Before vs After

### Before ❌
```
Root had 13+ files cluttering the directory:
- index.html
- styles.css
- script.js
- README.md
- QUICK_START.md
- ANIMATIONS_DETAILS.md
- ANIMATIONS_GUIDE.md
- ANIMATIONS_REFERENCE.md
- ANIMATIONS_VISUAL_GUIDE.md
- COMPLETE_ANIMATION_INVENTORY.md
- FINAL_SUMMARY.md
- IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md
- SEPARATION_OF_CONCERNS.md
- ... messy!
```

### After ✅
```
Clean root with only 4 essential files:
📦 Portfolio/
├── index.html          ← Portfolio
├── styles.css          ← Styling
├── script.js           ← JavaScript
├── README.md           ← Quick guide
└── docs/               ← All docs organized here
    ├── 11 guide files
    └── Well organized
```
